## 🧠 Startup Name: _AdsForge AI_ (placeholder, can be renamed)

### 🚀 MVP Startup Description

**AdsForge AI** is an AI-powered platform that simplifies Meta Ads campaign creation through natural language input. Our MVP enables users—especially small businesses, creators, and marketers—to launch ad campaigns by simply uploading their ad creative and describing their intent in plain English.

Instead of manually configuring dozens of ad settings in Meta Ads Manager, users describe what they want—like audience, location, budget, languages, and goals—and our AI turns that into a complete campaign setup.

### 🎯 Key MVP Features:

- **Natural Language Ad Creation**: Describe your campaign in plain text (e.g., “MMA gym ad targeting Europe, age 18+, budget $10/day for 2 weeks”).
- **Creative Upload**: Upload your video or image creative to be used in the ad.
- **AI Campaign Generator**: Automatically translates the description into:
  - Audience targeting (location, age, gender, language)
  - Budget and duration
  - Objective (e.g., traffic, engagement)
  - Ad copy and headline
- **Landing Page Generator**: Auto-generates a basic landing page with your branding and a lead form.
- **1-Click Meta Ads Publishing**: Users can review and edit the generated settings, then launch the campaign directly through Meta’s API with a single click.

### 🧩 Ideal For:

- Small business owners
- Fitness studios and gyms
- E-commerce brands
- Content creators and influencers
- Agencies looking to speed up ad ops

### 🌐 Tech Stack Highlights:

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with a rich form + preview UI
- **Backend**: Golang(Fiber) + OpenAI for AI processing
- **Meta API**: Integrated with Meta Marketing API for ad publishing
- **AI**: Used for both ad campaign parsing and landing page generation
